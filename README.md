# Simple Todo App

ðŸ”§ Project Overview
Frontend (HTML & CSS):

HTML structures the application, including input fields for new tasks, buttons for adding tasks, and a list to display current tasks.

CSS enhances the visual appeal, providing styles for different task states (e.g., pending, completed) and responsive design for various devices.

Backend (Java):

Java handles the application's logic, such as storing tasks, updating their status, and deleting them. It can also manage data persistence using file storage or databases, ensuring tasks are saved between sessions.

âœ… Key Features
Add Tasks: Users can input new tasks to be added to their to-do list.

Mark as Completed: Tasks can be marked as done, often visually indicated by a strikethrough or color change.

Delete Tasks: Users can remove tasks that are no longer needed.

Data Persistence: Tasks are saved using Java's file handling or database connectivity, ensuring they remain after closing the application.
